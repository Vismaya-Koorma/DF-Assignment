Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input the page reference string.
Step 3: Input the number of frames.
Step 4: Initialize
•	an empty list memory to store pages in frames
•	a counter page_faults = 0
Step 5: For each page p in the page reference string, repeat Steps 6–10.
Step 6 (Page Hit Check):
If p is already in memory:
•	Remove p from its current position (because it is now most recently used)
•	Insert/append p at the end of memory
Step 7 (Page Fault Case):
If p is not in memory:
•	Increase page fault counter → page_faults += 1
Step 8 (Check for Free Frame):
If memory has space (i.e., len(memory) < frames):
•	Add p to memory
Step 9 (No Free Frame – Replacement):
If memory is full:
•	Remove the Least Recently Used page → the first element in memory
•	Insert the new page at the end of memory
Step 10: Print the current memory state.
Step 11: After all pages are processed, print total page faults.
Step 12: Stop.
