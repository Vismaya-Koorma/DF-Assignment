ALGORITHM:

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input the size of the cache 
Step 3: Input the size of the memory
Step 4: Input the sequence of memory block references.
Step 5: Initialize the following:
	    1.Cache as empty
	    2.Frequency counter for each block
	    3.Hit count = 0
	    4.Miss count = 0
Step 6: Process each block in the reference sequence:
             If the referenced block exists in the cache:
		Increase the hit count
		Increment the frequency of that block
	     else
 		The miss count
		If free space is available in the cache:
			Add the block to the cache
		If the cache is full:
			Select the block with the minimum frequency (LFU)
			Remove that block from the cache
			Insert the new block
		Set the frequency of the inserted block
Step 7: Show the current cache status after every memory reference.
Step 8: Compute the hit ratio using:
		Hit Ratio = Number of Hits / Total Number of References
Step 9: Stop.
